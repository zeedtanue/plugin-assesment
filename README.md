 plugin assesment for otto international


This is an assesment for Otto International take home assignment. 

OPTION 1: CREATE A WORDPRESS EMAIL SENDER PLUGIN THAT, AT LEAST, HAS THE FOLLOWING:
1. A menu in the Dashboard where Target Users & User Roles can be chosen
2. A text input can be added
3. A send button which triggers the email (WP_mail function may help)

As a node.js developer I found out I have very limited knowledge in wordpress plugin development. This assessment does not produce 100% correct result what it demanded. 

I believe my limitation can be overcome with very short time period with a little guidance.
